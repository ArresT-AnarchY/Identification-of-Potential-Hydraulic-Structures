# Identification of Potential Hydraulic Structures with ArcGIS
This model can be used in modeling processes related to forest roads and watersheds. It can provide important data to forest road planners and environmental planners for infrastructure projects planned in the area. The accuracy and usefulness of the developed model is open to be supported and improved by field studies and literature reviews.

In the study, water lines cut by forest roads can be found automatically with ArcGIS modelbuilder. In addition, an automatic modularization system was created with Arcpy coding.


## Parameters
There are 3 parameters that need to be explained about the module.
**1) Boundary:** Area boundary layer
**2) Contour:** Isohypses curves layer
**3) Forest Roads:** forest roads layer
  
## Install 
Tested with Arcmap10.8.
1. Download the tbx file or python file
2. Open Arcmap. :)
3. Find the location of the tbx file with ArcCatalog.
4. You will see the model in the .tbx. You can start directly. Check out the parameters below.
